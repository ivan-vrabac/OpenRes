"""Account: name change and GDPR deletion (owner 2026-10-23).

Name change: the first one is free, then RENAME_STEP credits, more for every further change
(100,000, 200,000, 300,000 …; owner 2026-10-31: credits, the 1.2.3 diamonds are gone). The new name must pass names.name_problem (no rude or misleading names; such
accounts can be banned or deleted).

Deletion (GDPR): accounts up to DELAY_AFTER_DAYS old are deleted at once; older accounts are deleted
after DELAY_DAYS, and signing in during that time cancels the deletion. Deleting removes the
company (mines, HQ, warehouse, buildings, orders, messages, contacts …) and frees the name; other
players' history keeps the rows without the player's id.
